summary:
abstract: In the past years, with the development and widespread of digital technologies, everyday life has been profoundly transformed. The general public, as well as specialized audiences, have to face an ever-increasing amount of knowledge and learn new abilities. The EASEAI workshop addresses that challenge by looking at software engineering, education, and artificial intelligence research fields to explore how they can be combined. Specifically, this workshop brings together researchers, teachers, and practitioners who use advanced software engineering tools and artificial intelligence techniques in the education field and through a transgenerational and transdisciplinary range of students to discuss the current state of the art and practices, and establish new future directions.
