abstract: "This short paper reports our observations after six editions of the JUnitContest that benchmarks automated unit test generation tools for Java programs. We discuss our experience and depict the current state-of-the-art and identify potential future research directions. We advocate the use of benchmark as a standard practice to enhance maturity and foster adoption by the industry of automated test case generation tools."
