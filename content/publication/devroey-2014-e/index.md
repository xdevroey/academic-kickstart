abstract: "Featured Transition Systems (FTS) is a mathematical structure to represent the behaviour of software product line in a concise way. The combination of the well-known transition systems approach to formal behavioural modelling with feature expressions was pivotal to the design of efficient verification approaches. Such approaches indeed avoid to consider productsâ€™ behaviour independently, leading to often exponential savings. Building on this successful structure, we lay the foundations of model-based testing approach to SPLs. We define several FTS-aware coverage criteria and report on our experience combining FTS with usage-based testing for configurable websites."
