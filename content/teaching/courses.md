* [IN4315 Software Architecture](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/delftswa/) (guest lecturer),  [Software variability management](https://www.slideshare.net/XavierDevroey/software-variability-management-2019), Delft University of Technology (2019).

* CSE1110 Software Quality and Testing (guest lecturer), [Combinatorial Interaction Testing, an Introduction](https://www.slideshare.net/XavierDevroey/combinatorial-interaction-testing-an-introduction-2018), Delft University of Technology (2018).

* [IN4315 Software Architecture](https://delftswa2018.github.io) (guest lecturer),  [Software variability management](https://www.slideshare.net/XavierDevroey/software-variability-management-2017), Delft University of Technology (2018).

* INFOM110 Software engineering (guest lecturer), [Software testing: an introduction](https://www.slideshare.net/XavierDevroey/software-testing-an-introduction-2017), University of Namur (2017).

* INFOM110 Software engineering (guest lecturer), [Software testing: an introduction](https://www.slideshare.net/XavierDevroey/software-testing-an-introduction-2016), University of Namur (2016).

* INFOM110 Software engineering (guest lecturer), [Software testing: an introduction](https://www.slideshare.net/XavierDevroey/software-testing-an-introduction-2015), University of Namur (2015).

* Summer preparatory courses (lecturer), University of Namur (2013 - 2017). Introduction to programming and programming environment used during first year in computer science (8 hours).

* INFOB314/IHDCB332 Language theory: syntax and semantics, University of Namur (2011 - 2017). Definition and supervision of students projects, developed in small groups by third year students in day and evening lectures in computer science (30 hours). Each year, a small programming language (or domain specific language) is defined and students have to develop a compiler to translate this language to machine code using standard compiler development tools (Flex/Bison until 2015). Since 2015, the project has switched to Java, using ANTLR (and StringTemplate), Maven, and JUnit. During the project, students have to submit their code to an automated test evaluation tool that executes their compiler against a battery of tests (Jenkins since 2016).

* Algorithmic part II, University of Namur (2015 - 2017). Definition and supervision of the practical sessions on specification, formal proof, and implementation exercises for third year students in evening lecture in computer science (30 hours). Algorithms include memoization and dynamic programming, the greedy method, generate-and-test, heuristic methods, and abstract data types definitions.

* Introduction to programming, University of Namur (2011 - 2015). Definition and supervision of the practical sessions on basics of programming and specification for first year students in computer science and business engineering (45 hours).

* Development laboratory, University of Namur (2011 - 2015). Definition and supervision of students projects for first year students in computer science and business engineering (development done in small groups, 30 hours), and first year students in evening lecture in computer science (development done alone, 90 hours).
